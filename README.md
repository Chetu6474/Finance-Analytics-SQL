- **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** Controlling transactions effectively.  
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** Creating recursive and non-recursive CTEs for complex queries.  
- **Subqueries:** Retrieving specific data efficiently.  
- **Temporary Tables:** Using temporary tables for intermediate results.  
- **Views:** Simplifying complex queries through views.
